# Subt-challenge-autonomous-exploration
In this repository a simplistic autonomous exploration algotrithm is proposed to obtaine Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) datasets in subteranean environments. Using the onboard Lidar, and depth sensors are used to with mean thresholding to detect all possible paths fron the current postition. When multiple paths is detected, exploration nodes are added to the positional mapping, to depict paths which has not yet been exploured, and aids in entire map exploration. 

# DARPA Subt Simulation Environment Installation
